  **Gabriel Luna**

    My name is Gabriel Luna and I am in 11th grade. This summer I went to Lake Tahoe and San Francisco. My goals for this school year is to get better grades than last year. I like to play baseball for Chatsworth High School. My favorite summer food was fruit. This summer I also volunteered at a church.
